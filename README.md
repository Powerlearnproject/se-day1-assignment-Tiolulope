Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a field within computer science focused on designing, testing, and maintaining software systems.

Reliability: It ensures that software functions as intended without errors, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare and finance.

Efficiency: It streamlines developer workflows while upholding high-quality standards.

Scalability and Flexibility: It ensures systems can manage growing demands without compromising performance.

Security: It incorporates practices such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to safeguard user data.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): This era introduced structured programming concepts, emphasizing clear, logical code organization, which improved software reliability and maintainability.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software design by promoting modularity, reusability, and scalability through concepts like classes and objects.

The Agile Movement (2000s): Agile methodologies transformed software development by prioritizing iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability, enabling faster delivery and better responsiveness to user needs.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: This phase involves defining the purpose, goals, and scope of the software project, as well as identifying the resources and timeline required.

Requirement Analysis: During this stage, the specific needs and expectations of end-users are gathered and documented to create a detailed software specification.

Design: The system architecture and framework are developed, outlining how the software will function and how its components will interact.

Coding: The design is translated into actual code, where developers write and implement the software based on the predefined specifications.

Testing: The software is rigorously examined to identify and fix bugs, glitches, or any issues that may affect its performance or functionality.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology  
- Approach: Linear and sequential, where each phase (e.g., planning, design, coding, testing) is completed before moving to the next.  
- Flexibility: Low flexibility; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is finished.  
- Customer Feedback: Feedback is typically received late in the process, often after the product is fully developed.  
- Testing: Testing occurs at the end of the development cycle.  

Appropriate Scenarios:  
- Projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements (e.g., building a bridge or a simple inventory management system).  
- Industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as healthcare or aerospace, where documentation and predictability are critical.  

Agile Methodology 
- Approach: Iterative and incremental, with development broken into small cycles called sprints.  
- Flexibility: High flexibility; changes can be incorporated easily as requirements evolve.  
- Customer Feedback: Regular feedback is gathered and integrated into each sprint, ensuring the product aligns with user needs.  
- Testing: Testing is continuous and performed after each iteration.  

Appropriate Scenarios:  
- Projects with evolving or unclear requirements (e.g., developing a mobile app or a startup’s MVP).  
- Industries like software development or marketing, where rapid adaptation to market changes is essential.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
importance:
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
-Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person

Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.

Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.

Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.

Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
